# odin-recipes
This project focused on the HTML basics and how to use basic Git and GitHub.

This project starts with a page with links that lead to recipes
Each recipe includes a picture, ingredients and steps

Beyond the HTML basics such as using <p>, <ol>, <ul> and such, it helped with learning how to link CSS files to the HTML file.
  Properly linking to images was also learned
