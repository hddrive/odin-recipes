  <h4>Stuffed cabbage in a tomato sauce</h4>
  <p>An old family stuffed cabbage recipe, passed down</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 head cabbage</li>
    <li>1 T vegatable oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
    <li>3/4 C uncooked white rice, rinsed</li>
    <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
    <li>1 lb ground pork sausage</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>1(32 oz) can tomato juice</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook cabbage in boiling water until outer leaves pull away easily from the head, 
        3 to 5 minutes. Separate leaves and let cool. Reserve 1 1/2 cup cooking water.
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until translucent, 
        about 5 minutes. Stir in wet rice; cook and stir until moisture evaporates, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool, 
        about 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Mix beef, sausage, and egg together in a large bowl. Stir in cooled rice mixture.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place a golfball-sized amount of the beef mixture on the ribbed end of a cabbage leaf; roll up, 
        tucking in the sides. Repeat with remaining beef mixture and cabbage leaves.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place rolls seam-side down in a slow cooker. Cover with tomato juice. Pour reserved cooking water on top.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cook on High for 30 minutes. Switch to Low and cook for 6 1/2 hours.
    </li>
